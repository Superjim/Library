The renderBook function is responsible for creating and appending DOM elements to represent a book in the user interface. It first creates a div element to serve as a container for the book information, then creates text nodes for the book's title, author, number of pages, and current page. 

It also creates two button elements for the "read" and "delete" buttons. The book information and buttons are then appended to the container element, and the function sets the text and class of the "read" button based on the book's read property. Finally, the container element is returned by the function.
